# Argos Scripts

scripts that are used with [Argos Extension for Gnome](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1176/argos/). 

>Argos is a GNOME Shell extension that turns executables' standard output into panel dropdown menus. It is inspired by, and fully compatible with, the BitBar app for macOS. Argos supports many BitBar plugins without modifications, giving you access to a large library of well-tested scripts in addition to being able to write your own.

##Tilix

This script will put a menu option in the topbar that will give you a list of all your tilix session .json files and launch tilix with that session when you click on it.
